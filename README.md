# Ms. Walrus
A dashboard for people to host their own Walrus, without the hassle of tracking submissions manually.


## MVP
A host may create a new walrus, users (with the link) can submit to this walrus before the timer ends.
Once the timer ends, the submissions are revealed (but not who submitted them) and can be ranked in-site (while the anonymity is intact)
- Enjoyment
- Category fit
- Unfamiliarity
- Guess who submitted
- Pre-set Medals

The host may also add context to what they did/didnt enjoy about a particular submission etc.

Once it's all done, all the data is compiled into BBCode or Markdown that can be posted on the forums or Discord.

TL;DR attempting to fulfil the core of recent hosted Walrus' on MafiaScum have.
